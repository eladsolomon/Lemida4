1. Clone the repoistory to your computer.
  FSS algorithm:
  - In order to run the FSS algorithm call the function: FSS_Algorithm(records, labels, K=10)
  New_FSS algorithm
  - In order to run the FSS algorithm call the function: New_FSS_Algorithm(records, labels, K=10)
  Ahfs algorithm
  - In order to run the FSS algorithm call the function: AHFS_Algorithm(records, labels, K=10)
 Follow the documantion in the code for more deatils about the function and the parameters.
